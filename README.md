# visual-lcd-char-generator

This tool, [accessible here](http://www.marvinroger.fr/visual-lcd-char-generator/) allows you to create custom characters for HD44780 LCD modules using the Arduino LiquidCrystal library.
It is kind of ugly and bad coded for now, but it is functional (made in a few hours).
